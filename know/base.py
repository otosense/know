"""Base objects for know

The main object of this module is `SlabsIter`, and object to source and manipulate
multiple streams.

A slab is a collection of items of a same interval of time.
We represent a slab using a `dict` or mapping.
Typically, a slab will be the aggregation of multiple information streams that
happened around the same time.

`SlabsIter` is a tool that allows you to source multiple streams into a stream of
slabs that can contain the original data, or other datas computed from it, or both.

Note to developers looking into the code: The overview of the `SlabsIter` class:

>>> class SlabsIter:
...     def _call_on_scope(self, scope):
...         '''Calls the components 1 by 1, sourcing inputs and writing outputs in scope'''
...
...     def __next__(self):
...         '''Get the next slab by calling _call_on_scope on an new empty scope.
...         At least one of the components will have to be argument-less and provide
...         some data for other components to get their inputs from, if any are needed.
...         '''
...         return self._call_on_scope(scope={})
...
...     def __iter__(self):
...         '''Iterates over slabs until a handle exception is raised.'''

...                 try:

class SlabsIter:
    """Object to source and manipulate multiple streams.
    
    A slab is a collection of items of a same interval of time.
    We represent a slab using a `dict` or mapping.
    Typically, a slab will be the aggregation of multiple information streams that
    happened around the same time.

    For example, say and edge device had a microphone, light, and movement sensor.
    An aggregate reading of these sensors could give you something like:

    >>> slab = {'audio': [1, 2, 4], 'light': 126, 'movement': None}

    `movement` is `None` because the sensor is off. If it were on, we'd have True or
    False as values.

    From this information, you'd like to compute a `turn_mov_on` value based on the
    formula.

    >>> from statistics import stdev
    >>> vol = stdev
    >>> should_turn_movement_sensor_on = lambda audio, light: vol(audio) * light > 50000

    The produce of the volume and the lumens gives you 192, so you now have...

    >>> slab = {'audio': [1, 2, 4], 'light': 126, 'turn_mov_on': False, 'movement': None}

    The next slab that comes in is

    >>> slab = {'audio': [-96, 89, -92], 'light': 501, 'movement': None}

    which puts us over the threshold so

    >>> slab = {
    ...     'audio': [-96, 89, -92], 'light': 501, 'turn_mov_on': True, 'movement': None
    ... }

    and the movement sensor is turned on, the movement is detected, a `human_presence`
    signal is computed, and a notification sent if that metric is above a given theshold.

    The point here is that we incrementally compute various fields, enhancing our slab
    of information, and we do so iteratively over over slab that is streaming to us
    from our smart home device.

    `SlabsIter` is there to help you create such slabs, from source to enhanced.

    The situation above would look something along like this:

    >>> from know.base import SlabsIter
    >>> from statistics import stdev
    >>>
    >>> vol = stdev
    >>>
    >>> # Making a slabs iter object
    >>> def make_a_slabs_iter():
    ...
    ...     # Mocking the sensor readers
    ...     audio_sensor_read = iter([[1, 2, 3], [-96, 87, -92], [320, -96, 99]]).__next__
    ...     light_sensor_read = iter([126, 501, 523]).__next__
    ...     movement_sensor_read = iter([None, None, True]).__next__
    ...
    ...     return SlabsIter(
    ...         # The first three components get data from the sensors.
    ...         # The *_read objects are all callable, returning the next
    ...         # chunk of data for that sensor, if any.
    ...         audio=audio_sensor_read,
    ...         light=light_sensor_read,
    ...         movement=movement_sensor_read,
    ...         # The next
    ...         should_turn_movement_sensor_on = lambda audio, light: vol(audio) * light > 50000,
    ...         human_presence_score = lambda audio, light, movement: movement and sum([vol(audio), light]),
    ...         should_notify = lambda human_presence_score: human_presence_score and human_presence_score > 700,
    ...         notify = lambda should_notify: print('someone is there') if should_notify else None
    ...     )
    ...
    >>>
    >>> si = make_a_slabs_iter()
    >>> next(si)  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    {'audio': [1, 2, 3],
     'light': 126,
     'movement': None,
     'should_turn_movement_sensor_on': False,
     'human_presence_score': None,
     'should_notify': None,
     'notify': None}

     'should_turn_movement_sensor_on': True,
     'human_presence_score': None,
     'should_notify': None,
     'notify': None}
    >>> next(si)  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    someone is there
    {'audio': [320, -96, 99],
     'light': 523,
     'movement': True,
     'should_turn_movement_sensor_on': True,
     'human_presence_score': 731.1353726143957,
     'should_notify': True,
     'notify': None}

    If you ask for the next slab, you'll get a `StopIteration` (raised by the mocked
    sources since they reached the end of their iterators).

    >>> next(si)  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    StopIteration

    That said, if you iterate through a `SlabsIter` that handles the `StopIteration`
    exception (it does by default), you'll reach the end of you iteration gracefully.

    >>> si = make_a_slabs_iter()
    >>> for slab in si:
    ...     pass
    someone is there
    >>> si = make_a_slabs_iter()
    >>> slabs = list(si)  # gather all the slabs
    someone is there
    >>> len(slabs)
    3
    >>> slabs[-1]  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    {'audio': [320, -96, 99],
     'light': 523,
     'movement': True,

     'human_presence_score': 731.1353726143957,
